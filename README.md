# KSU Computer Science Program Schoolwork
Starting in 2022, this is all the schoolwork that I've completed while working on a Kansas State University Computer Science degree.
THIS IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF ALL CODE YOU WILL WRITE IN THESE CLASSES. This will mostly just be homework assignments/larger projects, given that I don't want to move every single lab over to this repo.

This includes schoolwork from the following courses - 
CIS 115
